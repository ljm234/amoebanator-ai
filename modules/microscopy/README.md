# Wet-mount microscopy helper (placeholder)

**Input:** 30–60 s CSF wet-mount clip (phase-contrast if available).

**Output:** A simple hint: “confidence high / low” and **ABSTAIN** on blur or low motion. No diagnosis.

**De-ID note:** Do not include names, MRNs, or voice tracks. Only upload de-identified CSF field-of-view clips.

**Clinical context:** PAM workup prioritizes immediate wet-mount microscopy for motile trophozoites, plus PCR confirmation through reference labs (e.g., CDC). This module is an attention aid, not a diagnostic.
